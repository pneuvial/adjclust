Title: Adjacency-Constrained Clustering of a Block-Diagonal Similarity Matrix
Description: Implements a constrained version of hierarchical agglomerative 
    clustering, in which each observation is associated to a position, and 
    only adjacent clusters can be merged. Typical application fields in 
    bioinformatics include Genome-Wide Association Studies or Hi-C data 
    analysis, where the similarity between items is a decreasing function of 
    their genomic distance. Taking advantage of this feature, the implemented 
    algorithm is time and memory efficient. This algorithm is described in 
    Chapter 4 of Alia Dehman (2015)
