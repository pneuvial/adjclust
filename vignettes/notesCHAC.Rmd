This document has two parts:

* the first part aims at clarifying relations between dissimilarity and 
similarity methods for hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) and at
explaining implementation choices in `adjclust`;

* the second part describes the different types of dendrograms that are 
implemented in `plot.chac`.

In this document, we assume to be given $n$ objects, $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ that have to
be clustered using adjacency-constrained HAC (CHAC), that is, in such a way that only
adjacent objects/clusters can be merged.

We refer to [5] for a comprehensive treatment of the applicability and interpretability of Ward’s hierarchical agglomerative clustering with or without contiguity constraints.

# Notes on relations between similarity and dissimilarity implementation

## Basic implementation of CHAC in `adjclust`

The basic implementation of `adjclust` takes, as an input, a kernel $k$ which
is supposed to be symmetric and positive (in the kernel sense). If your data are
under this format, then the constrained clustering can be performed with 
```{r ex-sim, eval=FALSE}
fit <- adjClust(k, type = "similarity")
```
or with
```{r ex-sim2, eval=FALSE}
fit <- adjClust(k, type = "similarity", h = h)
```
if, in addition, the kernel $k$ is supposed to have only null entries outside
of a diagonal of size `h`.

The implementation is the one described in [1].

## More advanced used for kernel or similarity matrices

### Non positive but normalized similarities

In this section, the available data set is a matrix $s$ that can either have 
only positive entries (in this case it is called a similarity) or both positive 
and non-positive entries. If, in addition, the matrix $s$ is *normalized*, 
*i.e.*, $s(i,i) + s(j,j) - 2s(i,j) \geq 0$ for all $i,j=1,\ldots,n$ then the 
algorithm implemented in `adjclust` can be applied directly, similarly as for a 
standard kernel (section 1). This section explains why this is the case.

The interpretation is similar to the kernel case, under the assumption that 
small similarity values or similarity values that are strongly negative are less 
expected to be clustered together than large similarity values. The application
of the method is justified by the fact that, for a given matrix $s$ described
as above, we can find a $\lambda > 0$ such that the matrix $k_\lambda$ defined
by
\[
  \forall\,1,\ldots,n,\qquad k_\lambda(i,j) = s(i,j) + \lambda 
  \mathbb{1}_{\{i=j\}}
\]
is a kernel (*i.e.*, the matrix $k = s + \lambda I$ is positive 
definite; indeed, it is the case for any $\lambda$ larger than the opposite of 
the smallest negative eigenvalue of $s$. [3] shows that the HAC obtained from 
the distance induced by the kernel $k_\lambda$ in its feature space and the HAC
obtained from the *ad hoc* dissimilarity defined by
\[
  \forall\, i,j=1,\ldots,n,\qquad d(i,j) = \sqrt{s(i,i) + s(j,j) - 2s(i,j)}
\]
are identical, except that all the merging levels are shifted by $\lambda$. 

In conclusion, to address this case, the command lines that have to be used are
the ones described in section 1.

### Non normalized similarities

Suppose now that the data set is described by a matrix $s$ as in the previous
section except that this similarity matrix is not normalized, meaning that, 
there is at least one pair $(i,j)$, such that
\[
  2s(i,j) > s(i,i) + s(j,j).
\]

The package then performs the following pre-transformation: a matrix $s^{*}$ is 
defined as
\[
  \forall\,i,j=1,\ldots,n,\qquad s^{*}(i,j) = s(i,j) + \lambda 
  \mathbb{1}_{\{i=j\}}
\]
for a $\lambda$ large enough to ensure that $s^{*}$ becomes normalized. In the 
package, $\lambda$ is chosen as
\[
  \lambda := \epsilon + \max_{i,j} \left(2s(i,j) - s(i,i) - s(j,j)\right)_+
\]
for a small $\epsilon > 0$. This case is justified by the property described in 
Section 2.1 (Non-positive but normalized similarities). The underlying idea is
that, shifting the diagonal entries of a similarity matrix does not change HAC
result and thus they can be shifted until they induce a proper *ad-hoc* 
dissimilarity matrix. The transformation affects only the heights to ensure that
they are all positive and the two command lines described in the first section
of this note are still valid.


### Case of dissimilarity data

The original implementation of (unconstrained) HAC in `stats::hclust` takes as 
input a dissimilarity matrix. However, the implementation of `adjclust` is based
on a kernel/similarity approach. We describe in this section how the 
dissimilarity case is handled.

Suppose given a dissimilarity $d$ which satisfies:

* $d$ has non negative entries: $d(i,j) \geq 0$ for all $i=1,\ldots,n$;

* $d$ is symmetric: $d(i,j) = d(j,i)$ for all $i,j=1,\ldots,n$;

* $d$ has a null diagonal: $d(i,i) = 0$ for all $i=1,\ldots,n$.

Any sequence of positive numbers $(a_i)_{i=1,\ldots,n}$ would provide a 
similarity $s$ for which $d$ is the *ad-hoc* dissimilarity by setting:
\[
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    s(i,i) = a_i\\
    s(i,j) = \frac{1}{2} (a_i + a_j - d^2(i,j))
  \end{array} \right. .
\]
By definition, such an $s$ is normalized and any choice for 
$(a_i)_{i=1,\ldots,n}$ yields the same clustering (since they all correspond to 
the same *ad-hoc* dissimilarity). The arbitrary choice $a_i = 1$ for all
$i=1,\ldots,n$ has thus been made.

The basic and the sparse implementations are both available with, respectively,
```{r ex-dissim, eval=FALSE}
fit <- adjClust(d, type = "dissimilarity")
```
and
```{r ex-dissim-sparse, eval=FALSE}
fit <- adjClust(d, type = "dissimilarity", h = h)
```

# Options for displaying the dendrogram

In this section, we suppose given an Euclidean distance $d$ between objects 
(even though the results described in this section are not specific to this 
case, they are described more easily using this framework). Ward's criterion, 
that is implemented in `adjclust` aims at minimizing the Error Sum of Squares 
(ESS) which is equal to:
\[
  \mbox{ESS}(\mathcal{C}) = \sum_{C \in \mathcal{C}} \sum_{i \in C} d^2(i, g_C)
\]
where $\mathcal{C}$ is the clustering and $g_C = \frac{1}{\mu_C} \sum_{i \in C}
i$ is the center of gravity of the cluster $C$ with $\mu_C$ elements [6]. In the
sequel, we will denote:

* *within-cluster dispersion* which, for a given cluster $C$, is equal to 
\[
  I(C) = \sum_{i \in C} d^2(i, g_C).
\]
We can prove that $I(C) = \frac{1}{2\mu_C} \sum_{i,j \in C} d^2(i,j)$ (see [4] 
for instance);

* *average within-cluster dispersion* which is equal to $\frac{I(C)}{\mu_C}$ and
corresponds to the cluster variance.

Usually, the results of standard HAC are displayed under the form of a 
dendrogram for which the heights of the different merges correspond to the 
linkage criterion
\[
  \delta(A,B) = I(A \cup B) - I(A) - I(B)
\]
of that merge. This criterion corresponds to the increase in total dispersion
(ESS) that occurs by merging the two clusters $A$ and $B$. However, for 
constrained HAC, there is no guaranty that this criterion is non decreasing (see
[2] for instance) and thus, the dendrogram build using this method can contain
reversals in its branches. This is the default option in `plot.chac` (that 
corresponds to `mode = "standard"`). To provide dendrograms that are easier to
interpret, alternative options have been implemented in the package: the first
one is a simple correction of the standard method, and the three others are 
suggested by [3].

In the sequel, we denote by $(m_t)_{t=1,\ldots,n-1}$ the series of linkage
criterion values obtained during the clustering.

## `mode = "corrected"`

This option simply corrects the heights by adding the minimal value making them
non decreasing. More precisely, if at a given step $t \in \{2,\ldots,n-1\}$ of
the clustering, we have that $m_t < m_{t-1}$ then, we define the corrected 
weights as:
\[
  \tilde{m}_{t'} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
    m_{t'} & \textrm{if } t' < t\\
    m_{t'} + (m_{t-1} - m_t) & \textrm{otherwise}
  \end{array} \right..
\]
This correction is iteratively performed for all decreasing merges, ensuring a
visually increasing dendrogram.

## `mode = "total-disp"`

This option represents the dendrogram using the total dispersion (that is the
objective function) at every level of the clustering. It can easily be proved
that the total dispersion is equal to ESS$_t = \sum_{t' \leq t} m_{t'}$ and that
this quantity is always non decreasing. This is the quantity recommended by [2]
to display the dendrogram.

## `mode = "within-disp"`

This option represents a cluster specific criterion by using the within cluster
dispersion of the two clusters being merged at every given step of the 
algorithm. It can be proved that this quantity is also non decreasing, but it is
depends strongly on the cluster size, leading to flattened dendrogram in
most cases.

## `mode = "average-disp"`

This last option addresses the problem of the dependency to cluster sizes posed
by the previous method (`"within-disp"`) by using the average within-cluster
dispersion of the two clusters being merged at every given step of the 
algorithm. This criterion is also a cluster specific one but does not guaranty
the absence of reversals in heights.


# Relations with 'hclust' and 'rioja'

As documented in [4], the call to ```hclust(..., method = "Ward.D")``` 
implicitly assumes that ```...``` is a *squared* distance matrix. As explained
above, we did not make such an assumption so 
```hclust(d^2, method = "Ward.D")``` and 
```adjClust(d, method = "dissimilarity")``` give identical results when the 
ordering of the (unconstrained) clustering is compatible with the natural 
ordering of objects used as a constraint. In addition, since 
```hclust(..., method = "Ward.D2")``` takes for linkage $\sqrt{m_t}$, 
```hclust(d, method = "Ward.D2")``` and 
```adjClust(d, method = "dissimilarity")``` give identical results for the 
merges and the slot ```height``` of the first is the square root of the slot 
```height``` of the second, when the ordering of the (unconstrained) clustering 
is compatible with the natural ordering of objects used as a constraint.

Finally, ```rioja``` uses ESS$_t$ to display the heights of the dendrogram 
(because, as documented above, this quantity is non decreasing, in the 
Euclidean case, even for constrained clusterings). Hence, 
```rioja(d, method = "coniss")``` and 
```adjClust(d, method = "dissimilarity")``` give identical results for the 
merges and the slot ```height``` of the first is the cumulative sum of the slot 
```height``` of the second.
