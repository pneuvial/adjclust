\usage{
adjClust(
  mat,
  type = c("similarity", "dissimilarity"),
  h = ncol(mat) - 1,
  strictCheck = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{A similarity matrix or a dist object. Most sparse formats from
\code{\link[Matrix]{sparseMatrix}} are allowed}

\item{type}{Type of matrix : similarity or dissimilarity. Defaults to
\code{"similarity"}}

\item{h}{band width. It is assumed that the similarity between two items is 0
when these items are at a distance of more than band width h. Default value
is \code{ncol(mat)-1}}

\item{strictCheck}{Logical (default to \code{TRUE}) to systematically check
default of positivity in input similarities. Can be disabled to avoid
computationally expensive checks when the number of features is large.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{chac}} which describes the tree
  produced by the clustering process. The object a list with the same
  elements as an object of class \code{\link{chac}} (\code{merge},
  \code{height}, \code{order}, \code{labels}, \code{call}, \code{method},
  \code{dist.method}), and an extra element \code{mat}: the data on which the
  clustering is performed, possibly after pre-transformations described in
  the vignette entitled "Notes on CHAC implementation in adjclust".

\description{
Adjacency-constrained hierarchical agglomerative clustering
}
\details{
Adjacency-constrained hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) is HAC in
which each observation is associated to a position, and the clustering is
constrained so as only adjacent clusters are merged. These methods are useful
in various application fields, including ecology (Quaternary data) and
bioinformatics (e.g., in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)).

This function is a fast implementation of the method that takes advantage of
sparse similarity matrices (i.e., that have 0 entries outside of a diagonal
band of width \code{h}). The method is fully described in (Dehman, 2015) and
based on a kernel version of the algorithm. The different options for the
implementation are available in the package vignette entitled "Notes on CHAC
implementation in adjclust".

\examples{
sim <- matrix(
c(1.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3,
  0.1, 1.0 ,0.4 ,0.5,
  0.2, 0.4, 1.0, 0.6,
  0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 1.0), nrow = 4)

## similarity, full width
fit1 <- adjClust(sim, "similarity")
plot(fit1)

## similarity, h < p-1
fit2 <- adjClust(sim, "similarity", h = 2)
plot(fit2)

## dissimilarity
dist <- as.dist(sqrt(2-(2*sim)))

## dissimilarity, full width
fit3 <- adjClust(dist, "dissimilarity")
plot(fit3)

## dissimilarity, h < p-1
fit4 <- adjClust(dist, "dissimilarity", h = 2)
plot(fit4)
